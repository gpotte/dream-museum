Dreamscape Installation

Dreamscape objects

Dreamscape is the translation of dreams in real life.
where is the frontier between the night and day and
how do your dreams impact your life?

For 1 months I catalogued my dreams, turning them into
3D animations.

Dreams have a big influence on me as I used to dream a
lot as a kid but it became rare as I grew up.
I believe that dreams have a big impact on society and
that peoples love to share them.

By develloping a collaborative VR experience I want to
create a safe heaven for people to share their dreams
and discover many mores.

Steps of development:
```
Proof of concept:

- Generate a never ending terrain
- place 3D objects
- implement a player (VR) -> the project should be
coded in such a way that it could run on any phone
- Generate movements of the dreams

Beta Version 1:

- Create shaders to add randomness in the appearance
of dreams (the way you remember a dream is always al-
tered)
- implement texts
- playable without VR

Beta Version 2:

- music (find a musician to collaborate)
- implementation of sound linked to 3D objects
- Grab & spin object

Release:

- website
- Steam implementation

### THIS ROADMAP IS NOT FINAL AND MIGHT BE EXPENDED
