Cheatsheet
```
Unity:
The main software used for developping

Procedural Generation:
In computing, procedural generation is a method of
creating data algorithmically as opposed to manually,
typically through a combination of human-generated as-
sets and algorithms coupled with computer-generated
randomness and processing power.

Shader:
In computer graphics, a shader is a type of computer
program originally used for shading in 3D scenes (the
production of appropriate levels of light, darkness,
and color in a rendered image). They now perform a va-
riety of specialized functions in various fields within
the category of computer graphics special effects.

```
Steam:
The main gaming platform in the world, softwares re-
leased on this platform can access the ‘workshop’
where players can create their own improvement to the
software

Dreamscape Installation

Dreamscape objects

Dreamscape is the translation of dreams in real life.
where is the frontier between the night and day and
how do your dreams impact your life?

For 1 months I catalogued my dreams, turning them into
3D animations.

Dreams have a big influence on me as I used to dream a
lot as a kid but it became rare as I grew up.
I believe that dreams have a big impact on society and
that peoples love to share them.

By develloping a collaborative VR experience I want to
create a safe heaven for people to share their dreams
and discover many mores.

Steps of development:
```
Proof of concept:

- Generate a never ending terrain
- place 3D objects
- implement a player (VR) -> the project should be
coded in such a way that it could run on any phone
- Generate movements of the dreams

Beta Version 1:

- Create shaders to add randomness in the appearance
of dreams (the way you remember a dream is always al-
tered)
- implement texts
- playable without VR

Beta Version 2:

- music (find a musician to collaborate)
- implementation of sound linked to 3D objects
- Grab & spin object

Release:

- website
- Steam implementation
